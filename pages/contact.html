      <p><b>Partnerships</b> or other offers of help, we are mainly interested
      in the areas of 1) network infrastructure 2) cryptocurrency financial
      infrastructure (ATMs, LoRA radio payments) and 3) monetary investment
      into our projects.</p>

      <p><b>Theoretical specialists</b> such as professors, please state your
      level of education and a link to a list of your published papers.
      We also offer a nascent graduate programme for graduates looking to
      gain field experience.</p>

      <p><b>Volunteers</b> who want to work with us: right now our capacity is
      limited to deal with managing online contributors whose commitment
      is often questionable. We are mainly interested in people who
      want to come here and work with us. That means quite an investment
      of energy on our part to bring you here, look after you, give you
      the requisite training to be ready for work, so anybody contacting
      us to volunteer must be serious. Please fill out and send us
      <a href="uploads/application-form.odt">this form</a>.

      <h3>What is polytechnics?</h3>
      <p>
        Lewis Mumford in the book "Technics and Civilization" introduced the key idea that technology was twofold:

        <ul>
            <li>
            Polytechnic, which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
            </li>

            <li>
            Monotechnic, which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
