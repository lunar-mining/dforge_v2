      <h3>What is polytechnics?</h3>
      <p>
        Lewis Mumford in the book "Technics and Civilization" introduced the key idea that technology was twofold:

        <ul>
            <li>
            Polytechnic, which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
            </li>

            <li>
            Monotechnic, which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
