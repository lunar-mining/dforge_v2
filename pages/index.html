      <h1>Polytechnology Committee <br> of North Syria</h1>
    <p>
    We are the technology development committee of North Syria.
	Our goal is to master technology, end the world state system and
	replace it with a democratic, autonomous paradigm.
    </p>

    <p>
	To achieve this, we will provide the necessary tools for decentralized
    governance and economics. Such tools will be democratic- with
    mechanisms for society to reach fair consensus, and autonomous- by
    preserving individuals right to decide and act freely.
    </p>

    <p>
	All around the world, humans are enslaved by a state apparatus that exploits
	them with technology.
    </p>

    <p>
	We are the promise of another technology: the technology of freedom.

      <h2>Main projects</h2>

      <h3>Self-sufficient Hardware</h3>
	  <p>
	  Our aim is to manufacture our own routers and telephones based off open
      source technology. The end goal is that North Syria becomes completely
      self sufficient in all of its technical requirements.
	  </p>

      <h3>Crypto and Blockchain</h3>
      <p>
	  Develop and popularize decentralized and anonymous crypto-based
      systems for society, politics and economy, and deploy tools for p2p self
      organization.
	  </p>

      <h3>Autonomous Networks</h3>
      <p>
	  Construct infrastructure to enable the population of North Syria
      to access free services for education and self organization, as well as
      for local ISPs to compete in selling internet access. The operation of
      this network is to be governed under a cooperative contract.
	  </p>

      <h3>Hacker Academies</h3>
      <p>
	  We are initiating open academies in every major city for young people to
      learn about technology, engineering, math and science. They will also be
      centers for disseminating our philosophy which is the guiding force of our
      work.

      <dl class="faqs">
        <dt>What is the project status?</dt>
        <dd>
            We are in the process of training developers, and are in the
            early stages of deploying infrastructure projects across
            North Syria (such as wireless community networks,
            operating system development, and cryptosystems).
        </dd>

        <dt>What is the role of technology in North Syria?</dt>
        <dd>
            With the war in Syria winding down, our emphasis is shifting into
            a society building project. As a landlocked region with hard
            borders on every side, technology is a multiplier for every area
            of society, including politics and economy. The region is facing
            serious challenges, and its ability to develop technology is
            crucial for its survival.
        </dd>

        <dt>What are your responsibilities?</dt>
        <dd>
            We are responsible for the civil technical development plans,
            reviewing proposals to the administration, iniating projects,
            and training technical specialists.
        </dd>

        <dt>What support are you looking for?</dt>
        <dd>
            We are looking for specialists that can provide training and
            expertise, either by visiting North Syria or online. We are
            also seeking partnerships with organizations that have relevant
            project proposals, and are recruiting developers that can come to
            North Syria for long periods of time and be responsible
            for projects.
